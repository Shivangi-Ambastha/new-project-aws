Provided zip file contains code for building Infrastructure on AWS

1) There are three folders
- network resources (builds network components)
- fb-modules (contains terraform modules)
- tfscripts (contains helper python scipts)
2) There is a file
- json file (contains variables for creating resources according to specified environment, e.g dev/qat/staging)

go through the entire code and create workflos to run the code as CI/CD on Azure Devops (Azure Pipelines)

Note: Azure Pipelines should follow best practises for deploying Infrastructure on AWS
e.g
1) should use terrascan for static analysis
2) state files of terraform code
3) Locking remote state
